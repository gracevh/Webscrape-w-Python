# Webscrape-w-Python

Scripts of scraped webpages using BeautifulSoup4, Scrapy, and R for geocoding.

This is linked to the Webscraping side project for determining: "is there is a relationship between a popular US outdoor recreational store and airports?" 
The repository will include scripts related to scraping data from the store website, Wikipedia, and others. Scripts for geocoding addresses and location names
as well as mapping of the geocoded coordinates. The primary aim of the project is practice with webscraping, with the secondary aim being to address 
the 'research question'.
